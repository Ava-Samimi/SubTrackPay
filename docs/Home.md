## Subscription & Billing Tracker – Documentation

This documentation describes the design rationale, system architecture, and data
model of the Subscription & Billing Tracker project.

The application is a full-stack system composed of a Node.js + Express REST API,
a React (Vite) frontend, and a PostgreSQL database managed through Prisma. Its
primary objective is to model and manage subscription-based services and their
associated billing and payment records, while enabling analytical and
statistical insights derived from stored data.
